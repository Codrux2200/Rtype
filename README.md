```for exemple a a client thread will send movement information to the server socket who will be sending back the actualized position of this client to the other ones```

## Client

The client part is where the gameloop mostly run, it's goal is too init and load all the graphic before the server take and update them.

## Prerequisites

## Installing the dependancies

On Linux:
- simply run install.sh with this :```sudo ./install.sh```

On Windows:

- run this the install.bat : ```$>install.bat```

## Usage

On Linux:
